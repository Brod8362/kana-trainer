Kana Trainer
============

Small rust application to train kana. Really, it's just a way to grind key/value pairs.

I wrote this for two main reasons:

1. To supplement a pending trip to Japan, and review my kana that I learned a few years back
2. To experiment with Qt in Rust

Currently, Hiragana, Katakana, and Hangul are included OOTB, but support to load your own character sets is planned.


## Building

Install rust, either via your package manager, rustup, or whatever windows users do to install software.

Run with `cargo run`.
